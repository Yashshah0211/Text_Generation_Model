# Text_Generation_Model
# 🧠 Shakespeare Text Generator (LSTM)

This project trains a character-level language model using an LSTM on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. Once trained, it can generate Shakespeare-style text one character at a time.

## 🔧 How It Works
- Dataset: Tiny Shakespeare (~100k characters)
- Model: Embedding + LSTM + Dense
- Input: 100-character sequences
- Output: Next predicted character

## 🚀 Usage
1. Train the model using `train_model.py`
2. Load weights and run inference with `generate_text.py`
3. Adjust temperature and prompt for creative results
